As per JAS website, JAS exists for the following reason.

> The Department of Environment (DOE), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES) constantly monitors the ambient environment quality of the country encompassing Air, River Water, and Marine.

In short, JAS monitors the quality of 3 key environmental resources - Air, River Water, and Marine Life.

In more technical language, they produce 4 real-time indices:
1. Air Pollutant Index (API)
2. Automated River Water Quality Index (RWQI)
3. Manual River Water Quality Index (RWQI)
    - Because it is done by ground agents, the manual index covers a lot more rivers than the automated version.
4. Marine Water Quality Index (MWQI)
    - This is done manually, at all major coastline points.
